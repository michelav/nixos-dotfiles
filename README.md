# NixOS Dotfiles

This repo contains the set up my local system as [nix expressions](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Overview_of_the_Nix_Language).
It's heavily inspired by Misterio's [nix config](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-config). 
Be sure to also check his getting starter [repo](https://github.com/Misterio77/nix-starter-configs).


## TODO

1. Organize repo into a more 'idiomatic' nixos thing
  - Maybe create folders for modules, overlays and packages
2. No keyboard and mouse after locking and dpms off in sway
3. Modularize window managers
4. Go back to stable and use unstable via overlays.
